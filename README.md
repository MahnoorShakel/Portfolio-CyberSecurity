# Portfolio-CyberSecurity
Project intoduction:
Going to sure that the  users on the team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 
MY task is to examine existing permissions on the file system.
I'll going to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. 
If they do not match, i'll going to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
# Modeling and evaluation:
going to use the lab provided by the couseera to solve this project .
# Conclusion:
Here are my recommendations for solving the problem and expanding on the project:

1. **Problem Solving Recommendations:**
   - **Assess Existing Permissions:**
     - Start by examining the current permissions on the file system. Identify which users have access to specific files and directories.
     - Look for any discrepancies between the existing permissions and the authorization requirements.
   - **Map Permissions to Roles:**
     - Consider implementing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.
     - Define roles based on user responsibilities (e.g., researcher, admin, manager).
     - Associate specific permissions with each role.
   - **Audit and Adjust:**
     - Regularly audit permissions to ensure they align with the organization's security policies.
     - Remove any unauthorized access by adjusting permissions accordingly.
     - Document changes for future reference.

2. **Future Steps for Expansion:**
   - **Fine-Grained Access Control:**
     - Explore Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to achieve fine-grained control.
     - Use attributes (such as user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental attributes) to define access policies.
   - **Automate Permissions Management:**
     - Consider scripting or using tools to automate permission adjustments.
     - Regularly validate and update permissions based on user roles and responsibilities.
   - **Logging and Monitoring:**
     - Implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms.
     - Track permission changes, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious activity.
   - **User Training and Awareness:**
     - Educate users about permissions and their responsibilities.
     - Promote security awareness to prevent accidental misconfigurations.
